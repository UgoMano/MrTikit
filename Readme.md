#MrTikit iOS
The following will describe how to use the MrTikit iOS System. The MrTikit iOS system is intended for users to directly view their ticket information. Additionally, the iOS system is designed to provide a tool that allows event managers to scan QR tickets from a mobile device.  

##Getting Started
To start you must first obtain a copy of the MrTikit mobile iOS application. Due to the application still being in v1.0.0-beta, you must setup your device directly with a MrTikit staff member.
